1. Have to work on the algorithm editor, to ensure the tabs are working properly
2. On clicking an algo from the algo list menu the pseudocode should be in pseudocode tab, the configuration should be in the configs tab 
[e.g. start vertex, DFS on forest, etc. for DFS algo]
3. Implement the start simulation and stop simulation and simulation speed controller -- super easy, 10 minutes 
4. Implement the console for logs and feature to clear the console, just like my LEO-SAT-SIM
5. Implement a few to more features like clear the graph editor, reset graph, export data [graph picture as svg, adjacency matrix, console logs, etc.]
6. Lock the graph_editor while starting a simulation and unlock it when the simulation stops
7. Make the random graph generation and user accessible feature through a button
8. Implement few more of the graph algorithms for future simulation
